# Module1Challenge

In this Challenge I learned a lot, it helped me develop the necessary skills to add Semantic Elements to the starter code.
I ended up getting a way better understanding by not understanding it at first.
Every doubt I had would lead me to finding the answer and while finding that answer I ended up learning a lot more in the process.
So I can now look at every error as a pathway to more understanding on the subject overall. 
I learned how the HTML file relates to the CSS file.
Initially I somewhat understood the concept but it was not until I practiced and worked on the code that I got a way better comprehension on the matter.
